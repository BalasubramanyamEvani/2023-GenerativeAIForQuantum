## Before Class

### Books
#### Main Book: 
- [Octopus Book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Quantum-Computers-Essential-Algorithms/dp/1492039683)   
    We will be working mostly out of this book.

#### Extra Reading:
- [Blue Book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Computer-Scientists-Yanofsky/dp/0521879965)    
    This book gives a great explanation on how to conceptualize Quantum Computers. First few chapters are great if you don't feel confident with the math.
- [Gentle Book](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608150244118.pdf)    
    A very computer science take on quantum computers. A good read if you are hoping to do research.

### Notes
- Reminder to bring computer to class.

### Summary
In this lecture, we will dive into the fundamental concept of qubits. We will explore how qubits differ from classical bits and how they allow for the representation of quantum information. We will also discuss the principles of superposition and entanglement, which are key properties of qubits that enable quantum computation.
