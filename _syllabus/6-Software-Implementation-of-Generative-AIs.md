In this lecture, scheduled for June 1, we will focus on the software implementation of generative AI models. We will explore popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, which provide powerful tools and libraries for developing and training generative AI models. We will discuss the key concepts and techniques involved in implementing and optimizing these models using these frameworks. Additionally, we will examine practical examples and case studies to understand the software engineering aspects of working with generative AI models.
