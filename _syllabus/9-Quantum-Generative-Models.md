Join us on June 13 as we explore the fascinating world of quantum generative models. In this lecture, we will introduce you to quantum generative models such as Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) and Quantum Variational Autoencoders (qVAEs). These models leverage the unique properties of quantum computing to generate new data samples and learn intricate data representations. We will delve into the principles, architectures, and applications of these cutting-edge models in quantum computing platforms. Get ready to unlock the potential of quantum generative models and witness their impact on the field of artificial intelligence.
