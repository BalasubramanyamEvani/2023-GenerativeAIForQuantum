I"š<p>In the eleventh class on June 20, we will focus on LLM data preparation and finetuning techniques. Preparing data is a crucial step in effectively training large language models. We will discuss data preprocessing methods, including cleaning, tokenization, and formatting, to ensure optimal model performance. Additionally, we will delve into finetuning strategies to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains. By the end of this session, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to prepare data and finetune large language models to achieve desirable outcomes. Donâ€™t miss this opportunity to enhance your skills in working with LLMs!</p>
