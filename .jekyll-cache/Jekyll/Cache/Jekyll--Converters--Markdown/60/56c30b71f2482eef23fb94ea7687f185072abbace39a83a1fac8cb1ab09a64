I"<p>In this lecture, which will take place on May 25, we will delve into the fundamentals of generative models. Specifically, we will explore two popular types of generative models: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We will discuss the principles behind these models and how they can be used to generate new data samples that resemble a given training dataset. Additionally, we will explore applications and considerations related to generative models in various domains.</p>
